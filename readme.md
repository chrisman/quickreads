It might actually be a bookclub micro-service

## Problem

I like reading books, but, man, they're just, ugh, so long. And who has the time to, like, pick the thing up and flip to a page and then start reading.

## Solution

A novel serializing email subscription service.

Select a book from the catalog, select a frequency and time for it to be delivered, how long of a snippet you want (15 - 30 minutes), and then the parts will start being delivered to your inbox.
